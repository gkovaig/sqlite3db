sqlite3db - A simple wrapper class for working with sqlite3 databases

# DESCRIPTION

This wrapper class is intended to help simplify your programmatic 
interactions with sqlite3 databases in Python. It'll allow you to 
quickly create a database object and begin executing SQL statement(s)
against it. There is no need to worry about opening connections to the 
database, creating database cursors on those connections, or tracking
what connections and/or cursors are opened or closed at any given time.
All of this boilerplate housekeeping code is handled by the class' 
methods for you. The aim here is to simply get you working with your 
database sooner rather than later.

# USAGE

Check out the example database interactions in the class' main function. 
i.e., at the end of the sqlite3b.py file.

# STATUS

A work in progress.
